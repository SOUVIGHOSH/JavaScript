        The DOM specification explains the structure of a document and provides objects to manipulate it. There are non-browser instruments that use DOM too.
        For instance, server-side scripts that download HTML pages and process them can also use the DOM. They may support only a part of the specification though.
        There’s also a separate specification, CSS Object Model (CSSOM) for CSS rules and stylesheets, that explains how they are represented as objects, and how to read and write them.
        */

        //The Browser Object Model (BOM) represents additional objects provided by the browser (host environment) for working with everything except the document.
        //The navigator object provides background information about the browser and the operating system. There are many properties, but the two most widely known are: navigator.userAgent – about the current browser, and navigator.platform – about the platform (can help to differentiate between Windows/Linux/Mac etc).
        console.log(navigator.userAgent,navigator.platform);
        //The location object allows us to read the current URL and can redirect the browser to a new one.
        console.log(location.href);
        //The functions alert/confirm/prompt are also a part of the BOM: they are not directly related to the document, but represent pure browser methods for communicating with the user.

        //The DOM represents HTML as a tree structure of tags. Here’s how it looks:
        //Tags are element nodes (or just elements) and form the tree structure: <html> is at the root, then <head> and <body> are its children, etc.
        //The text inside elements forms text nodes, labelled as #text. A text node contains only a string. It may not have children and is always a leaf of the tree
        // Spaces at string start/end and space-only text nodes are usually hidden in tools
        //A document with unclosed tags: …will become a normal DOM as the browser reads tags and restores the missing parts:
        //An interesting “special case” is tables. By DOM specification they must have <tbody> tag, but HTML text may omit it. Then the browser creates <tbody> in the DOM automatically.
        // Everything in HTML, even comments, becomes a part of the DOM.
        /*
        Even the <!DOCTYPE...> directive at the very beginning of HTML is also a DOM node. It’s in the DOM tree right before <html>. Few people know about that. We are not going to touch that node, we even don’t draw it on diagrams, but it’s there.
        The document object that represents the whole document is, formally, a DOM node as well.
        There are 12 node types. In practice we usually work with 4 of them:
        document – the “entry point” into DOM.
        element nodes – HTML-tags, the tree building blocks.
        text nodes – contain text.
        comments – sometimes we can put information there, it won’t be shown, but JS can read it from the DOM.
