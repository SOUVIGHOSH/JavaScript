            People who start to use promises sometimes don’t know about chaining, so they write it this way. Generally, chaining is preferred.

            Sometimes it’s ok to write .then directly, because the nested function has access to the outer scope. In the example above the most nested callback has access to all variables script1, script2, script3. But that’s an exception rather than a rule.

            //Asynchronous tasks need proper management. For that, the ECMA standard specifies an internal queue PromiseJobs, more often referred to as the “microtask queue” (V8 term).
            //when a promise is ready, its .then/catch/finally handlers are put into the queue; they are not executed yet. When the JavaScript engine becomes free from the current code, it takes a task from the queue and executes it.
            //An “unhandled rejection” occurs when a promise error is not handled at the end of the microtask queue.
            //If we need to guarantee that a piece of code is executed after .then/catch/finally, we can add it into a chained .then call.

            promise = Promise.reject(new Error("Promise Failed!"));

            promise = Promise.reject(new Error("Promise Failed!"));

            // Promise Failed!
            window.addEventListener('unhandledrejection', event => console.log(event.reason));

            promise = Promise.reject(new Error("Promise Failed!"));

            /*
            If we didn’t know about the microtasks queue, we could wonder: “Why did unhandledrejection handler run? We did catch and handle the error!”
            But now we understand that unhandledrejection is generated when the microtask queue is complete: the engine examines promises and, if any of them is in the “rejected” state, then the event triggers.
            In the example above, .catch added by setTimeout also triggers. But it does so later, after unhandledrejection has already occurred, so it doesn’t change anything.
